    The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure, can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. 
    A stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures arranged in whorls around the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle.
     The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. 
     Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth, and in monocotyledons, may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as tepals
